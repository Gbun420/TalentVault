## Skills
These skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.
- gh-address-comments: Help address review/issue comments on the open GitHub PR for the current branch using gh CLI; verify gh auth first and prompt the user to authenticate if not logged in. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md)
- gh-fix-ci: Inspect GitHub PR checks with gh, pull failing GitHub Actions logs, summarize failure context, then create a fix plan and implement after user approval. Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing PR CI/CD checks on GitHub Actions and wants a plan + code changes; for external checks (e.g., Buildkite), only report the details URL and mark them out of scope. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md)
- notion-knowledge-capture: Capture conversations and decisions into structured Notion pages; use when turning chats/notes into wiki entries, how-tos, decisions, or FAQs with proper linking. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/notion-knowledge-capture/SKILL.md)
- notion-meeting-intelligence: Prepare meeting materials with Notion context and Codex research; use when gathering context, drafting agendas/pre-reads, and tailoring materials to attendees. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/notion-meeting-intelligence/SKILL.md)
- notion-research-documentation: Research across Notion and synthesize into structured documentation; use when gathering info from multiple Notion sources to produce briefs, comparisons, or reports with citations. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/notion-research-documentation/SKILL.md)
- notion-spec-to-implementation: Turn Notion specs into implementation plans, tasks, and progress tracking; use when implementing PRDs/feature specs and creating Notion plans + tasks from them. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/notion-spec-to-implementation/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/glennbundy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime "## Skills" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
